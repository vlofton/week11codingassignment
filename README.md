Instructions:

In Visual Studio Code, write the code that accomplishes the objectives listed below and ensures that the code compiles and runs as directed. 

Create a new repository on GitHub for this week’s assignments and push this document, with your project code, to the repository.

Include the URLs for this week’s repository and video where instructed.

Submit this document as a .PDF file in the LMS. 

Coding Steps:

Using any of the tools you’ve worked with so far, create a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

Create a Tic-Tac-Toe game grid using your HTML element of choice. 

When a cell in the grid is clicked, an X or O should appear in that spot depending on whose turn it is.

A heading should say whether it is X’s or O’s turn and change with each move made.

A button should be available to clear the grid and restart the game.

When a player has won, or the board is full and the game results in a draw, a Bootstrap alert or similar Bootstrap component should appear across the screen announcing the winner. 






Video Steps:

Create a video, up to five minutes max, showing and explaining how your project works with an emphasis on the portions you contributed. 
This video should be done using screen share and voice over. 
This can easily be done using Zoom, although you don't have to use Zoom, it's just what we recommend. 
You can create a new meeting, start screen sharing, and start recording. 
This will create a video recording on your computer. 
This should then be uploaded to a publicly accessible site, such as YouTube. 
Ensure the link you share is PUBLIC or UNLISTED!
If it is not accessible by your grader, your project will be graded based on what they can access.
